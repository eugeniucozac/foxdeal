# Task Manager

This Task Manager application is a modern web app built with React, TypeScript, Apollo Client, and GraphQL. It offers a dynamic interface to manage tasks efficiently, leveraging the latest web technologies for fast, responsive user experiences.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App and enhanced with Apollo Client for GraphQL integration and Material-UI for sleek, material design components.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (preferably the latest LTS version)
- npm (comes installed with Node.js)

### Installation

Clone the project repository:
```bash
git clone
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd client
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Server

Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```
This command runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload with edits, and lint errors will be displayed in the console.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the build folder, optimizing it for the best performance. The build is minified, and filenames include hashes. Your app is ready for deployment!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Create, update, and delete tasks using a sleek interface.
- **GraphQL Integration**: Interact with your backend through efficient GraphQL queries and mutations.
- **Real-time Updates**: Leverage Apollo Client to manage data and provide real-time updates to the UI.
- **Material Design**: Utilize Material-UI components for a modern look and feel.
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript integration ensures type safety across the app, enhancing development efficiency and reducing runtime errors.
